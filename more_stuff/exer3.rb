=begin 

exception handling allows for a code to catch when an error/exception is thrown during execution.
this way, I can run the code in its entirety, even when an exception is thrown during 
the middle of execution. I can also do something like print custom message to screen 
when an exception is thrown or save the exception message to display it later.
